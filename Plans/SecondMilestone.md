## Plan for the second milestone

1. Create event system (part of platform-dependent runtime component)
1. Invent algorithm of optimal displaying of terrain with different level of details
1. Improve compression algorithm
    - No data loss during compression and decompression
    - Reduction in output file size for several test height maps
1. Add hydraulic erosion algorithm
    - Hydraulic erosion algorithm implemented
    - There is a setting for erosion parameters (intensity, number of iterations)
    - Visually, erosion creates the shapes of rivers, canyons

1. Add "curves"
    - Algorithm for redistributing height values ​​using a function specified by some points implemented
    - Realization for adding the points via UI implemented

## Plan for the third milestone

1. Invent algorithm of proof of concept displaying of terrain with different level of details (19th)
1. Create event system (part of platform-dependent runtime component) (19th)
1. Add some new parameters to generator (optionals from previous milestones)
1. Add texture generation algorithm
1. Create completely new shader system for graphics engine
	- Every material is presented by nodes, by design it's in SSA representation
	- Add some optimitzations to shader
	- Translate it into SPIR-V (optional)

## Plan for the third milestone

1. Add some new parameters to generator (optionals from previous milestones)
1. Add texture generation algorithm
1. Create completely new shader system for graphics engine
	- Every material is presented by nodes, by design it's in SSA representation
	- Add some optimitzations to shader
	- Translate it into SPIR-V
1. Add Vulkan or DirectX support if it was't done in [first milestone](./FirstMilestone.md)
